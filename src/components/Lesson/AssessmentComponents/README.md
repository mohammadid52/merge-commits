## Differences between Survey- & Lesson-Checkpoints

---
#### The basic design of the survey- & lesson-checkpoints is like this:

a. **Survey** => has multiple pages with only checkpoints, so pagination can be introduced.

b. **Lesson** (student or teacher) => has multiple pages & there might or might not be checkpoints, but not every page is a checkpoint. So the checkpoint will be loaded conditionally per page and
not grouped together.

#### Further differences:

a. **Survey** =>

*Multiple pages with only checkpoints and...*

    - Has welcome message 
    - Has survey instructions
    - Has closing message

b. **Lesson** =>

*Multiple pages with mix of checkpoints and other components, some pages might have
multiple checkpoints and some might have none at all...*

    - No welcome message 
    - No survey instructions
    - Mix of checkpoints & other components on a page
